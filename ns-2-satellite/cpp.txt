Windows Support for Ns-2.27 and Earlier
Ns versions up to 2.1b9 work under Windows using Visual C++ (Native Port). 
However, this method is not actively supported anymore in more recent versions. 
If you need to use such a version on Windows, you can still find the old instructions on the Windows / Visual C++ page. 
Since version 2.1b9, ns has used Cygwin/gcc instead of Visual C++. Instructions for running ns 2.1b9, 2.26, and 2.27 under Cygwin are available here.
